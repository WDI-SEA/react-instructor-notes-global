### Quizzes are optional!

They are not mentioned in the lessons.

**Note** At the end of each quiz, the student will see a link to the review guide for that section. This link is wrong (and difficult to fix, as it's on myGA staging). Use the review guide link referenced in the relevant file here.

**In each quiz file here:**
- Quiz links to give to the students are in their associated files.
  - The quizzes are hosted on the myGA platform.
- The review guide link.
- The rest of the file is the quiz question and what the student sees if they get it correct.
  - Multiple choice questions have "explanation" under the answer choices.
  - Multi select questions have "incorrect explanation" and "correct explanation" above the answer choices.
  - Correct answers have an asterisk after the answer choice.
