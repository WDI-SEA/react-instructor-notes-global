### Questions:
- Answers with an asterisk are correct.

_Prompt_:  You have a main component, `Milkshake.js`, which imports and will render UI from a component `Ingredients.js`. Which file does the below code go in?

```js
ReactDOM.render(
<Ingredients />,
document.getElementById('root')
)
```

_Choices_:

1. `Milkshake.js` *
2. `Ingredients.js`

_Explanation*_:  When we call the Ingredients component with `<Ingredients />`, the Ingredients component is going to return the JSX inside its `render` method. You can't call a component within itself! This would go in `Milkshake.js`, which would actually render the JSX returned by the Ingredients component.

-----------------------------------

_Prompt_:  A component is being passed a prop named `flavor`. What JSX would the component return in its `render` method to display the prop in a paragraph?

_Choices_:

1. `<p>My favorite ice cream is {this.props.flavor}!</p>` *
2. `<p>My favorite ice cream is {props.this.flavor}!</p>`
3. `<p>My favorite ice cream is {props.flavor}!</p>`
4. `<p>My favorite ice cream is {this.flavor}!</p>`

_Explanation_:  You distinguish JavaScript in JSX with curly braces `{}`. The syntax to refer to the prop is `this.props.flavor` - which says, "in *this* file, find a *prop*, named *'flavor'*".

-----------------------------------

_Prompt_:  Is this a valid Component declaration?

```js
  class Paintings extends Component {
    render () {
      return (
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h3>It is time for tea.</h3>
      )
    }
  }
```

_Choices_:

1. Yes
2. No *

_Explanation_:  No, because the `render` method can only return one JSX element. To make this valid, the two heading tags need to be wrapped in a single tag. For example, the `render` method could return a `<div>` with the `<h1>` and `<h3>` elements inside of it.

----------------------------------

_Prompt_:  Is this a valid way to, in a file called `Spices.js`, render the JSX that the `Cinnamon` component returns to the screen?

```js
ReactDOM.render(
<Cinnamon>,
document.getElementById('root')
)
```

_Choices_:

1. Yes
2. No *

_Explanation_:  No! Whenever you use a self-closing tag in JSX, you **MUST** end it with a `/`. The correct syntax is `<Cinnamon />`.

----------------------------------

_Prompt_: What, specifically, happens when this method is called?

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Kangaroos />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

_Choices_:

1. The `ReactDOM.render` method generates a virtual DOM node containing whatever content the `Kangaroos` component returns, and appends that to the element with an ID of `root`. Then, React compares the virtual DOM to the regular DOM and updates on the webpage only the elements that have changed. *

2. The `ReactDOM.render` method generates a virtual DOM node containing whatever the JSX that the `Kangaroos` component returns. React then reloads the entire webpage, changing only the element with an ID of `root`.

3. The `ReactDOM.render` method returns JSX to the `Kangaroos` component, and the `Kangaroos` component returns a virtual DOM node. React updates on the webpage only the elements specified in `Kangaroos` that have changed.

4. The `ReactDOM.render` method generates a new element with an ID of `root`, which it populates with the JSX returned from the `Kangaroos` component. React updates the virtual DOM to have this new element, which the browser sees to dynamically change the page with the new element on it.

_Explanation_:  The `ReactDOM.render` method generates a virtual DOM node containing whatever content the `Kangaroos` component returns, and appends that to the element with an ID of `root`. Then, React compares the virtual DOM to the regular DOM and updates on the webpage only the elements that have changed.


-----------------------------------

_Prompt_:  If you have multiple components written in a single file, you can then have multiple default export statements at the bottom of that file - one for each component.

_Choices_:

1. True
2. False *

_Explanation_:  Only one default is allowed per file. The `default` keyword means that if we try to import anything from this file that the app can't find, JavaScript will automatically revert to importing the component exported as `default` instead. If there are multiple default statements, the app won't know what to do! On a side note, it is best practice to split different components into their own file, so hopefully you won't run into this issue.

----------------------------------

_Prompt_:  What is React.js?

_Choices_:

1. A framework created by developers at Facebook. It is aimed at being the 'view' of your Javascript application. It focuses on creating a component-based architecture. *
2. A boilerplate that eliminates displaying JSON retrieved from your server. It updates the model portion of your web application to dynamically render UI.
3. A library of independent, reusable pieces of user interface that you can call upon to add variability to your application.
4. All of the above

_Explanation_:  React is a framework created by developers at Facebook. It is aimed at being the 'view' of your Javascript application. It focuses on creating a component-based architecture.

-----------------------------------

_Prompt_:  Take a look at the following React file. Choose the reason(s) it won't run properly.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Store from './Store.js';

var groceryList = {
  important: "milk",
  spices: [
    "pepper",
    "salt"
  ]
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Store
    buy_me={groceryList.milk}
    me_too={groceryList.spices}
  >,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

_Choices_:

1. The `Store` component call needs to end with `/>`, not just `>` *
2. The prop name and variable name need to match - `buy_me` needs to be `milk` and `me_too` needs to be `spices`
3. The `var groceryList` declaration needs to be inside the `render` method
4. When passing the props into `Store`, the syntax is `this.groceryList.important` and `this.groceryList.spices`


_Explanation_:  This code is very close to correct. The only thing missing is that the component needs to end with `/>` to close the tag. Without adding the props, it would look like `<Store />`.


----------------------------------


_Prompt_:  How could you use `create-react-app` to create a new app called `jungle_maze`?

_Choices_:

1. `create-react-app npm/start jungle_maze`
2. `create-react-app jungle_maze.js`
3. `create-react-app jungle_maze` *
4. `create-react-app index/jungle_maze.js`


_Explanation_:  It's simple to create an app using `create-react-app` - just call the tool with the name you want for your app. In this case, `create-react-app jungle_maze`

----------------------------------

_Prompt_:  If I'm displaying multiple nested components, assuming the `Flowers` component is being passed all necessary props and the `Daisy` component is imported and written correctly, is this valid syntax?

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Daisy from './Daisy.js';

class Flowers extends Component {
  render() {
    let allDaisies = [
      <Daisy body={this.props.spring} />,
      <Daisy body={this.props.rabbits} />
    ]

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.favorites}</h1>
        <h3>Daisies:</h3>
        {allDaisies}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

_Choices_:

1. Yes
2. No

_Explanation_:  It is! You can pass JavaScript objects into JSX using `{}` curly braces. Just as we can add to the JSX the passed in props, we can also add to the JSX the variable `allDaisies` by putting `{allDaisies}`.
