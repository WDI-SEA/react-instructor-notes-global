# React Module Breakdown
Note: The term "React Module" refers to all 8 React repos taught sequentially.

### Types of Activities in the React Module:
- **Codealong**:
  - Students do this in class with you. You do it on the screen, and they follow along on their laptops.
  - All codealongs can be instead assigned as exercises to the students to follow the instructions on their own.
- **Exercises**:
  - Exercises with instructions for students to do on their own.
  - Exercises can be run as codealongs, with the exception of the blog and film projects.
- **Projects**:
  - Blog Project: There is a blog project that students build upon throughout the week. Each exercise builds on the last until students have a functioning project by the end of the week. 
    - Each solution is a branch in the `react-blog-project` repo. (Each exercise's starter code is also in the repo, though students won't need that as the exercise is built throughout the class).
  - Film project: There is also a film project that students build upon throughout the week. Each exercise builds on the last until students have a functioning project by the end of the week. 
    - Each solution is a branch in the `react-film` repo. (Each exercise's starter code is also in the repo, though students won't need that as the exercise is built throughout the class).
    - A strong suggestion is to make each section of the project homework, but save time in class for questions.
    - This uses ES6 before it's introduced. Another option is to assign the first two film exercises together after the 6th ES6 lesson.
    - The film exercises are not referenced anywhere else in the class and can safely be ignored if you so choose.
- **Videos**:
  - Short (<3 min) videos explaining a topic.
- **Existing Repo Labs**:
  - There are two labs (ATM and TicTacToe) where students fork a repo with existing code and add features to it.
- **Self Project**:
  - The last repo is a self-project prompt. This is designed for a student to build their own website over the course of an entire day.
